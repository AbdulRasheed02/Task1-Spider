# Lorentz and Spi Factor Calculator

Calculator app with the following features:

#### LEVEL-1:

• To calculate the Lorentz factor for different input speeds of the moving observer.

  𝛾=1/√(1−𝑣^2/𝑐^2)

  where,\
  𝛾 = Lorentz factor\
  v = speeds of the moving observer\
  c = speed of light = 3 x 108 m/s

• Show “Toast” message for invalid inputs.

#### LEVEL-2:

Add a Practice session feature where user will input ‘v’ (speeds of the moving observer) and their calculation of Lorentz factor, the app needs to check whether the calculated value matches the Lorentz factor for the given ‘v’. It should also have the following features:\
• Change the background colour of the screen according to the result.\
• Add vibration for wrong answers and reveal the correct answer.

#### LEVEL-3:

• Calculate our very own ”Spi” factor which depends on present time by the following formula,

𝜑= (𝑡𝐻)!/(𝑡𝑚^3 + 𝑡𝑠)

where,\
𝜑= Spi factor\
𝑡𝐻= Current hour in 12 hour format of time\
𝑡𝑚= Current minutes\
𝑡𝑠= Current seconds

• Have a Home screen displaying options to choose between Lorentz factor and Spi factor calculator.

Brownie points: Update Spi factor every second dynamically.
